# Visualizing Global Temperature Time Series

This project was done as part of the **IDEAS – Institute of Data Engineering, Analytics and Science Foundation (ISI Kolkata)** internship (25th August 2025 – 19th September 2025).

## 📌 Project Overview
The project analyzes and visualizes **global temperature data** using time series techniques. The goal is to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns that reflect climate change.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of long-term trends
- Seasonal decomposition
- Comparison across data sources
- Rolling averages for smoothing
- Draft LaTeX report for academic submission

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `07-visualizing-time-series-dataset-global-temp_data_report.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `report/report.tex` → LaTeX formatted report
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies
